git-and-github
This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Git Hub.

Things I did for making this repository.

+ Created an empty repository named git-and-github in GitHub.
+ Copied the contents from the page titiled create a new repository on the command line and the lines are
```
echo "# git-and-github" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Yahinisekar/git-and-github.git
git push -u origin main
```
I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After Opened CMD I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
This First line echo `"# git-and-github" >> README.md` created an `README.md` file with the content "# git-and-github".
